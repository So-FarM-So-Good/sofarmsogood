					<p>Nowadays, sugar beet is an important harvest of Turkey agriculture. However, quota limitation of the sugar beet factories push the farmers to monopolize and sell their products under their value to the bigger sellers. It causes some local farmers to give up sugar beet production. With the help of So Farm So Good, the farmers will be able to communicate with other local farmers to get their harvest in one quota and establish small cooperatives together. In this way, they will be able to sell their harvest to sugar beet factories even though their own harvest amount is under the factory quota. Also, money and harvest transaction will require confirmation of both farmers and company. This will provide security in company and farmer affairs.</p>
